The defeat the wizard project is an interactive game using object oriented programming in python. The project proves that I understand the priniciples of OOP. The program is interactive allowing the players to use a menu to make choices to manage attacks, use heal methods, and to ultimately try to defeat the wizard. Utilizing the starter code provided, I added the classes Archer and Paladin. Additionally, I added special attacks and abilities to these classes.
